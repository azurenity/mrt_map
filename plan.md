# Divided into portions:

1. create a git hub repo for the project
2. find a way to map the mrt map in code
- enum (diff py file), linked list, graph
3. save the timings between each mrt station
- doable with step 2
4. accept user inputs 
- rest api, postman for testing
5. attempt to find the fastest way from inputted station to said station
- topological sort, dijkstra algorithm
6. if possible make it into a telegram bot
- research online
